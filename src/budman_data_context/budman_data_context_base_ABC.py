""" BudManDataContext_Base: Abstract Base Class interface.

    A Data Context (DC) is a component of the MVVM design pattern for 
    applications. It separates concerns by Model, View Model and View object
    functional layers, providing an traction for data used by ViewModels, 
    Models and a View.

    The properties and methods reflect the BudMan application design language, 
    in terms of the domain model objects, command processing, etc. So, it is
    Budget Domain Model (BDM) aware, but not bound to a particular View, 
    ViewModel, or Model interface. But, the key concepts in the BDM concerning
    Financial Institutions (FI), Workflows (WF), Workbooks (WB), and the
    Budget Data Model (BDM_STORE) are all represented in the Data Context.

    A Data Context is not a Model, nor a View Model, it is a bridge between
    the two. It provides a way to access and manipulate data without exposing
    the underlying implementation details. It provides the application context
    at any moment in time, so the values change.

    This ABC defines the interface which is applied by concrete implementations.

    Each property and method herein documents its purpose. Most of the 
    properties and methods, if the return value is not None, return basic 
    data types, or aliases for those defined in the Design Language namespace.
    However, some of the return a BUDMAN_RESULT, which is a tuple of
    (success: bool, result: Any). This scheme is used to be forgiving when
    errors occur. The success value being True means no error and the result
    value is the output of the function. When success is False, the result
    value is a string describing the error.
