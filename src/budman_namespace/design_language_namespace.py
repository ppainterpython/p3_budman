# workbooks are processed an moved through a workflow. Each workflow is composed
# tasks performed on the workbooks. A workbook can be input to or output from a 
# workflow , or be held as working data in a workflow. So, workflows have a 
# purpose associated with the folders to designate them as input, working, or 
# output, the WF_PURPOSE.
